The aim of our platform is to provide creative individuals with a portal to express themselves in a distraction-free environment, without any hindrance, or unnecessary infringements. We like to keep the focus on the stuff that matters - the content, and the experience of writing your heart out. 
Our writer is very intuitive to use for anybody and everybody who wants to, with a simple editing and formatting process.

Also, apart from the regular typing procedure, one can use the mic, available to record sentences, or phrases, and add to the existing content. Keep in mind, though, that the content may not be formatted by default, and will need formatting and punctuation.

The website uses <a href="https://gist.github.com/alotaiba/1730160">Google's Speech To Text API</a> to transcript audio to text, and MediumEditor's Jquery plugin to provide formatting options.
